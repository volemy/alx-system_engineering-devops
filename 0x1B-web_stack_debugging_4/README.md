# 0x1B. Web Stack Debugging #4

## Description
In this task, we addressed a high number of failed requests in our Nginx web server setup.

## Steps Taken
1. Analyzed Nginx error logs to identify recurring errors.
2. Reviewed Nginx configuration files for misconfigurations.
3. Optimized Nginx settings to better handle incoming requests.
4. Ensured server had sufficient resources to handle the load.
5. Tuned PHP-FPM settings for improved performance.
6. Implemented caching mechanisms to reduce server load.
7. Conducted load testing using ApacheBench to verify improvements.

## Configuration Changes
- Adjusted Nginx worker processes and connections.
- Increased server resources (CPU, memory).
- Tuned PHP-FPM settings for optimal performance.
- Implemented Nginx FastCGI caching for improved response times.

## Future Maintenance
- Regularly monitor Nginx error logs for any new issues.
- Perform periodic load testing to ensure server can handle expected traffic.
- Keep Nginx and PHP-FPM configurations optimized for performance.
