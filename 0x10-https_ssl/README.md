# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

## Overview
This project, 0x10. HTTPS SSL, delves into the fundamental concepts of securing website traffic using HTTPS SSL. Through a series of tasks, participants will explore DNS, web stack debugging, and the significance of HTTPS SSL in maintaining data security. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of HTTPS SSL, its roles, encryption of traffic, SSL termination, and related concepts.

## Background Context
In the world of web security, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted between clients and servers is paramount. HTTPS SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure Secure Sockets Layer) serves as a crucial protocol for securing website traffic by encrypting data and providing authentication mechanisms.

## Resources
Participants are encouraged to explore the following resources to gain a deeper understanding of HTTPS SSL and related concepts:

What is HTTPS?
What are the 2 main elements that SSL is providing
HAProxy SSL termination on Ubuntu16.04
SSL termination
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants should be able to explain the following concepts without the aid of external resources:

Understand the roles of HTTPS SSL and its importance in securing web traffic.
Explain the purpose of encrypting traffic and the benefits it provides.
Define SSL termination and its significance in the context of web servers.
