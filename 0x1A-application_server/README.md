# 0x1A. Application server

## Overview
This project focuses on setting up an application server to serve dynamic content for the AirBnB clone project. The application server will complement the existing Nginx web server setup, enhancing the web infrastructure to handle dynamic requests efficiently.

## Background Context
In web infrastructure, a web server, such as Nginx, is primarily responsible for serving static content like HTML, CSS, and image files. However, for dynamic content generation, an application server is required. In this project, we'll integrate an application server, configure it to work alongside Nginx, and serve the AirBnB clone project.
