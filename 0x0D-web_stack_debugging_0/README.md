# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

## Overview
Network basics encompass the fundamental concepts and protocols that enable communication between devices in a computer network. Key concepts include IP addresses, subnets, routing, protocols (such as TCP/IP and UDP), and networking devices like routers and switches.

# Docker

### Overview
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can run consistently across various environments, making application deployment and scaling more efficient.

## Key Concepts
Containerization: Packaging an application and its dependencies into a container.
Docker Images: Lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an application.
Dockerfile: A script defining steps to build a Docker image.
Docker Compose: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
Importance
Docker simplifies the deployment process, ensures consistency across different environments, and promotes scalability in modern software development.

# Web Stack Debugging
Overview
Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving issues in the components of a web application's stack, including the web server, database, and application code.

## Key Concepts
Error Logs: Examining logs for error messages from different components.
HTTP Status Codes: Understanding status codes to diagnose issues (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
Tools: Using debugging tools like curl, Postman, and browser developer tools.
Importance
Debugging is a critical skill for web developers and system administrators to ensure the smooth operation of web applications, identify bottlenecks, and enhance performance.
