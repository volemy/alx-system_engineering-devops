# Postmortem
## Background Context
In the world of software engineering, failures are inevitable. Whether it's due to bugs, traffic spikes, security vulnerabilities, hardware malfunctions, natural disasters, or human error, systems will encounter issues that lead to downtime or disruption of services. However, failure is not necessarily a negative outcome; it presents an opportunity for learning and improvement. As software engineers, it's crucial to analyze and understand why failures occur to prevent them from happening again in the future.

One of the key practices in the tech industry for addressing failures is conducting postmortems. A postmortem, also known as an incident report, is a detailed summary created by the team responsible for managing the affected system after an outage or incident. The primary objectives of a postmortem are:

Providing Transparency: To offer all employees within the organization easy access to information regarding the cause of the outage. This transparency is essential for managers and executives to comprehend the impact of the incident on the company's operations.

Identifying Root Causes: To ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage are identified and addressed effectively. By understanding why the failure occurred, measures can be taken to prevent similar issues in the future.
